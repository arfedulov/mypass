        TODO:
         If not logged in (should have jwt and secret key in session storage),
         redirect to login page.

         Show a list of secrets;
         Each secret has readable name and unfoldable description.
         Name and description are searchable.

         Values are shown as dots (like password).
         Value's visibility can be toggled.

         Values are encrypted. Decryption happens
         only on toggle visibility. It happens on client side
         using a key from session storage.

         The page contains "Add secret" link to add-secret page
    -->
